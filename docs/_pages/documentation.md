## Structure of Bt Studio

Bt Studio can be separated into 5 sections:

<!-- {% include gallery id="framefulllight" caption="Sections of Bt Studio" %} -->
{% include gallery id="framefulldark" caption="Sections of Bt Studio" %}

* Header menu
* Status Bar
* File Browser
* File Editor
* Behavior Tree Editor

We will dive into each section functionality in the next sections.

### Header Menu

The header menu is where you control the projects, the universes and the execution.

It can also be separated into 3 main parts:

<!-- {% include gallery id="frameheaderlight" caption="Image with explanation" %} -->
{% include gallery id="frameheaderdark" caption="Sections of the Header Menu" %}

* Project Name: indicates the name of the project
* Universe Name: indicates the name of the selected universe, if one is not selected it will display the message: "No Universe selected"
* Action Buttons: buttons for the different available actions, more detail in the following subsections, they appear from left to right order.

#### Project Menu

Opens the project menu where you can switch, delete or create projects.

{% include gallery id="projectlist" caption="Project menu" %}

##### Create a new project

1. Click on the create "Create New Project" button at the bottom of the project menu
2. Write the name in the input field
3. Press the "Create Project" button

<!-- {% include gallery id="newproject" caption="Image" %} -->
{% include gallery id="newprojectcropped" caption="Create a new project" %}

##### Delete a project

On hover over a project in the project menu a red button appears. If that project is not currently selected you can delete it.

This will delete the entirety of the project including the universes for that project.

{% include gallery id="projectlistdelete" caption="Delete a project" %}

##### Switch projects

To switch projects it is only required to click on top of the desired one.

#### Universe Menu

Opens the universe menu where you can switch, delete or add universes.

<!-- {% include gallery id="universelist" caption="Universe menu" %} -->
{% include gallery id="universelistcropped" caption="Universe menu" %}

##### Add a new custom universe

Functionality not available right now online.

Functionality in alpha in local mode, it may not work properly.

##### Add a new universe from Robotics Backend

1. Click on the create "Import from Robotics Backend library" button at the bottom of the project menu
2. Write the name in the input field
3. Select the universe from the list of available ones.
4. Press the "Create Universe" button

<!-- {% include gallery id="dockeruniverse" caption="Image" %} -->
{% include gallery id="dockeruniversecropped" caption="Add a new universe from Robotics Backend" %}

##### Delete an universe

On hover over a universe in the universe menu a red button appears. If that universe is not currently selected you can delete it.

##### Switch universes

To switch universes it is only required to click on top of the desired one.

#### Settings Menu

Opens the settings menu. These settings are applied and stored per project.

#### Save project Button

Saves the Behaviour Tree diagram, not the code in the File Editor.

#### Download project Button

Downloads the project as a ROS2 package prepared for execution locally.

#### Play/Pause simulation Button

Plays or pauses the simulation. For it to work an universe needs to be selected and the simulation working.

Do not spam the button repeatedily because it can malfunction.

{% include gallery id="playmonitorgif" caption="Play/Pause simulation" %}

#### Reset simulation Button

Restarts the simulation to the start state. For it to work an universe needs to be selected and the simulation working.

Do not spam the button repeatedily because it can malfunction.

{% include gallery id="restartgif" caption="Restart simulation" %}

### Status Bar

The status bar is where you can manage the connection with the Robotics Backend.

It has the next structure when it is not connected with the Robotics Backend:

{% include gallery id="framestatusreconnectdark" caption="Image with explanation" %}
<!-- {% include gallery id="framestatusreconnectlight" caption="Image with explanation" %} -->

And after connecting it displays the following information:

{% include gallery id="framestatusdark" caption="Image with explanation" %}
<!-- {% include gallery id="framestatuslight" caption="Image with explanation" %} -->

If the Robotics BAckend is not connected make sure that the Robotics Backend docker is launched (TODO link here) and if it is, press the button and wait a couple of seconds 

### File Browser

### File Editor

### Behavior Tree Editor

## Blackboard port values

When a port value is named enclosed in curly brackets: {example}; then this port will be part of the blackboard instead of just a value.
This will be indicated in the diagram by the port turning to black.

The blackboard allows you to connect different input and output ports from different parts of the diagram.
